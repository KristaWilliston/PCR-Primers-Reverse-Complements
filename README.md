# PCR-Primers-Reverse-Complements

Use PrimerBank (“google PrimerBank”) to look up PCR primers for your favorite gene.
Use Search By: “NCBI Gene Symbol”, Species: “Human” to find PCR primers for your gene. 
Write a program to compute the reverse complement sequence of both the forward and reverse primer (in one program).

In this program, I worked with primers from the HERC2 gene.
